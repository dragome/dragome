#5' Dragome Tutorial

Let's create a simple crud using Dragome.

We will make use of some tools provided by Dragome SDK: 
* service creation
* visual components
* model binding
* template engine
* template repeaters 

First of all we create a simple activity for building our page extending DragomeVisualActivity.

``` Java
public class PersonCrudPage extends DragomeVisualActivity
```
